As groups grow, so do their moderation problems. We're all busy people who don't have time to monitor groups 24/7. Users often complain about admin abuse and have no recourse. Who moderates the moderator?

Presenting [Kleros Moderate](https://kleros.io/moderate), a crowd-sourced content moderation tool using [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.limo/) and [Kleros](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/) on [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosis.io/).

When users are reported, a question is created on Reality.Eth asking 'did the user break the rules?'. The question can be answered yes/no with a bond (5 DAI). Successful reports result in penalties,

- 1st Report: 1 day ban
- 2nd Report: 1 week ban
- 3rd Report: 1 year ban

Answers to reports can be disputed, creating a case in the Kleros court. Refer to the [docs](https://shotaro.gitbook.io/kleros-moderate/products/moderate/susie-or-kleros-moderator) to learn more.
