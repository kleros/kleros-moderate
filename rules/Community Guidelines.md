Conversations on social media platforms like telegram or discord are sometimes taken over by groups using toxic memes and negative language. Not only does this make many feel alienated from these spaces, but it is detrimental to the  ability to have productive debates and collaborate as a community.

This policy serves one main purpose:

> *Committing to the principle of openness, and facilitating a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.*

This community is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.
The following behaviors violate the code of conduct and will lead to progressive consequences (eg. escalating ban duration) from Kleros Moderated social media platforms:

1. Threats of violence or violent language.
2. Sexually explicit material or language.
3. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
4. Scamming, spamming.
5. Impersonating another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else.
Doxxing and invasion of privacy: posting other people’s personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject’s consent, may be considered to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject.
